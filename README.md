###  Letter intervention to GPs practices to promoting prescription uptake in school-age children with asthma during summer holidays: a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial

#### Project

A pragmatic cluster randomised trial was conducted in England, involving GP practices contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). GP practices were stratified by practice size (decile) and randomly allocated (1:1) to either the intervention or control group. In June 2021, the intervention group received a letter from CPRD via mail and email, informing them about the PLEASANT study findings and offering recommendations. The primary outcome was the proportion of children with asthma (aged 4 to 15) who collected a preventer prescription in August and September 2021. The trial received both University of Sheffield and Independent Scientific Advisory Committee (ISAC) Ethics approval and was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05226091).

#### R scripts
  R scripts that were used for the processing of data that was received from CPRD and is a extract of their Aurum database which was created in May 2022.
  Scripts are used for cleaning of the data to creating the final analysable dataset for different outcome measures as stated in the protocol (see registered clinical trial above).
  Scripts were run in the order that they are present (e.g. A00 - C03) as to represent a form of data pipeline.
