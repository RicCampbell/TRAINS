## Things to think about/remember
## - There are multiple tables in the data we will receive
## - Field names are not unique across tables (constype appears in more than one table)
## - Some "id" fields are not unique, e.g. consid, and have to be used on conjunction with others (p_patid)

## Dates could be in dd/mm/yyyy format

## Do we have a list of unique CPRD codes that we are interested in?
##  - this is for medcode field in Clinical table

## Notes taken from the overview CONSORT diagram 
## - Remember to check for full duplicates
## - Remember to reduce to the date range that we are interested in
## - Look at the number of clinical and consultation records that join up
## - WANT TO LOOK AT LEFT HALF OF DIAGRAM WHEN UNDERSTAND THE DATA BETTER
##   - THINK it's to do with, scheduled/unscheduled can be deferred by either the code that you can link to a person/visit, or the type of visit it was 
##     deemed in other table
##
## - Consultation date does not always match the date event date recorded for that consultation within other tables
##   - Non matched records in 'clincial' table were included if relavent - This is in a table in doc ******
##   - Non matched records in immunisation, therapy, referral, and test were not included

### - List of 'ummatched/historical' codes that are used needs to be created from data management process doc - but they don't have code, just description ****
## Ah crap there's some fun 'vague' rules that they applied e.g. medcode desc includes word "seen", included this
## Then everything else still not matched, were included!! ****

## This might be a list that we have to get checked over again by Rami


## Something about using 'medcode description' first in the clinical data (table), then the consultation type, then look at the other tables

## Three lists of Medcode descriptions for splitting into scheduled/unscheduled, not applicable, and unknown ***** WILL NEED THESE
## Again there are extra 'rules' that need to be applied

## If not coded looking at the medcode description ('medcode'), then look at consultation type


## If a consultation has conflicting contact types, unscheduled takes precedence, then scheduled, then unknown


## Unmatched consultation records or those matched with  unknown clinical data, are determinded by looking at;
## immunistaion data, then therapy, then referral then test data

## Have to look out for 'historical data'??


### I think we're getting data from the AURUM dataset, while PLEASANT was working from the GOLD dataset - collected from different GP software

library(data.table)
library(readxl)

  asthma_inclusions <- fread("D:/reference_data/asthma_inclusions.csv",
                             colClasses = "character")
  
  asthma_exclusions <- fread("D:/reference_data/asthma_exclusions.csv",
                             colClasses = "character")

## The two files downloaded from the data processing document
 ## I think this is list of CPRD unique codes, table 'Clinical', field 'medcode' 
  pegasus <- fread("D:/reference_data/data_management_process_appendix/pegasus_medical_appendix.txt",
                   colClasses = "character")
  
 ## I think this is list of entity type, table 'Clinical' and 'Test', field 'enttype'
  entity <- data.table(read_xlsx("D:/reference_data/data_management_process_appendix/entity_appendix.xlsx",
                  sheet = "entity"))
    
  
## I think this is the coding to the 'Clinical' table, field 'constype'
  
  cot <- data.table(read_xlsx("D:/reference_data/cot.xlsx",
                              sheet = "Sheet1",
                              col_names = TRUE))
  
  ## Need to change coloumn names
